## How To Use

```bash
#Use the below command and click one of the items in the gui that shows up to choose your class
/class
# BEWARE, choosing to change your class after already having a class costs 5 diamonds by default (Can be changed in config)
```
After using the /class command and choosing your class, you cannot change class unless you pay 5 diamonds, soon we will be adding customization so that you can change this cost or remove it altogether
